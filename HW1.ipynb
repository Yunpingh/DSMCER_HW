    "#  <font color='red'>Reading Question</font>\n",
    "<font color='red'>Some machine learning projects overly simplified the chemistry behind material. For example in Reference 39, they saw monomers as elementary unit in the design of polymeric materials for organic electronics; AlphaFold saw aminoacid as  elementary unit predicting protein geometry. However, in both cases hydrogen bonding plays an crucial part in the results, which they overlooked. What would be the impacts of this? Will their results still be liable?</font>\n"
